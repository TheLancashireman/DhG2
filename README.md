# DhG2
## Dave's genealogy assistant v2.0

This is a rewrite of the original, using python instead of perl and cleaning up a lot of the
cruft caused by major concept and design changes over the years.

At the moment the program is very much under development. Adding and editing card files is supported,
but the analysis of relationships and html generation is missing.

If you want a usable program, go for the original DhG. The database format will remain the same.

Released under GPL version 3.0 - see LICENSE and gpl-3.0.txt

The program is unashamedly command-line driven. It doesn't give you a pretty interface to a hidden database.
Instead, it helps you to create structured text files, one per person, then analyses the files to produce ancestor
and descendant trees and immediate family reports. It can even produce a static HTML web site.

The text file approach means that you always have full control of your data

# To do

There is always lots to do. :-)
