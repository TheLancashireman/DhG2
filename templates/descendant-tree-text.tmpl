	Input is a dictionary containing the following items:
		cardbase	: the server's 'cards' directory
		subj		: the subject of the card
		partners	: a list of the subject, partners and children.
					: At this level, the left partner is always the subject

	Each item in items is an instance of a class with the following members:
		level		: the level. Level 1 is the top level
		left		: the left-hand person of a partnership:
					: 	at the top level, the subject
					:	at lower levels, a child of the level above
		right		: the right-hand person of the partnership
					:	None if no partners
					:	person with name "not known" if there are children with an unknown partner
		children	: a list of the children of the partnership. It's a recursive structure
	An individual can occur more than once in an items list, when there are multiple partners

	Each person (subj, left, right) is an instance of a class; see person class in person-card-html.tmpl
	Only vital and file are used.
